# BIA -- Collection of Biologically inspired algorithms
This repo contains implementations of some well known, popular biologically inspired algorithms
(swarm intelligence, evolutions...) in Python. The implementations and visualisations are done in an easy, as simple as possible way.
Therefore, they are not really optimized for performance. 

## Algorithms
- Ex1 -- Blind Search
- Ex2 -- Hill Climbing
- Ex3 -- Simulated Annealing
- Ex4 -- Genetic Travelling Salesman
- Ex5 -- Differential Evolution
- Ex6 -- Particle Swarm Optimization
- Ex7 -- SOMA
- Ex8 -- Ant Colony Optimization
- Ex9 -- Firefly
- Ex10 -- Teaching-Learning Based Optimization
